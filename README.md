# Dependencies
- Written in Python 3.9.13
- pandas,numpy,matplotlib,random
# Running the Code
- Source code must be in same directory as ```datasets``` folder containing datasets included in my submission (edited first line of each to help with formatting)
- Must include my version of ```hw3.py``` in same directory
- Original file is ```hw3.ipynb```, if you are able running all code cells like this is ideal
- Otherwise, running  ```hw3.py``` in a directory containing previously mentioned files will run all code at once through Python.
